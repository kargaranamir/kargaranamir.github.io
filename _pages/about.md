Hi there! I’m Amir :wave:, currently a PhD student at CIS LMU Munich advised by Prof. Hinrich Schütze.

My research centers on NLProc, particularly on the topic of multilingualism. I am working to broaden the reach of NLProc technology by enabling its application in more languages.

Before coming to LMU, I completed my M.Sc. in CE at Sharif University of Technology, 2022. I did my B.Sc. at Isfahan University of Technology double majored in EE and CE, 2020.
