I'm a <b>Computer Science Ph.D. student</b> at [<b>Munich University</b>](https://cis.lmu.de), advised by Prof. [<b>Hinrich Schütze</b>](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qIL9dWUAAAAJ), and a junior member of the [<b>Munich Center for Machine Learning</b>](https://mcml.ai).  

I earned an M.Sc. in Computer Engineering from [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.sharif.edu/)  and B.Sc. degrees in Electrical and Computer Engineering from [Isfahan University of Technology](http://english.iut.ac.ir/). I was a research intern at the [User Interfaces group, Aalto University](http://userinterfaces.aalto.fi/), contributing to [Aalto Interface Metrics (AIM)](https://github.com/aalto-ui/aim) for computational GUI evaluation.


<p>
  I’ll be on the job market in <span style="color:red;">Spring 2026</span>, exploring opportunities in research or applied NLP roles.  
  My work focuses on large language models, multilingual NLP, agents, translation and the intersection of NLP and programming languages.
  If you think there’s a potential fit, I’d love to hear from you.
