Hello! Iâ€™m Amir ðŸ‘‹, a Ph.D. student at [CIS, LMU Munich](https://cis.lmu.de) advised by Prof. [Hinrich SchÃ¼tze](https://www.cis.lmu.de/schuetze). My primary focus is on scaling NLP horizontally to include more languages in the map of NLP.

Before starting my Ph.D., I completed my M.Sc. in Computer Engineering at [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.sharif.edu), 2022. I did my B.Sc. at [Isfahan University of Technology](https://english.iut.ac.ir) double majored in Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering, 2020.
