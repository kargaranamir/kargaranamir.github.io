Hi there! I’m Amir, currently a PhD student at [CIS LMU Munich](https://www.cis.lmu.de/) advised by [Prof. Hinrich Schütze](https://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/schuetze/).

My research centers on Natural Language Processing, particularly on the topic of multilingualism. I am working to broaden the reach of NLP technology by enabling its application in more languages.

Before coming to LMU, I completed my M.Sc. in CE at [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.sharif.edu/), 2022. I did my B.Sc. at [Isfahan University of Technology](http://english.iut.ac.ir/) double majored in EE and CE, 2020.
