Growing up in a household adorned with numerous old books, especially poetry collections, I was captivated by the literary world. As a child, I would find solace in my own company, sitting in a quiet room, immersing myself in the verses of Rumi, Khayyam, Rudaki, and Khaqani. It was an enchanting experience that I often yearn to relive.  Here, I'd like to share my favorite poems in Persian literature:



--------------------

```
O you who are the letter of the divine command, who are you,
O you who are the mirror of the beauty of the king, who are you,
Outside of you, there is nothing in the whole world,
Seek within yourself whatever you desire, for you are.
```
