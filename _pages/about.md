Hi there! I am an M.Sc. student at the [Department of Computer Engineering](http://ce.sharif.edu/) at [Sharif University of Technology](http://www.en.sharif.edu/), where I work on the Natural Language Processing and Human-Computer Interaction. I am supervised by Dr. [Abbas Heydarnoori](http://ise.ce.sharif.ir/director/). Summer 2021 and 2022, I was a research assistant in the [User Interfaces Research Group](https://userinterfaces.aalto.fi/) led by Prof. [Antti Oulasvirta](http://users.comnet.aalto.fi/oulasvir/) at [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en). We study and implement different user interface evaluation metrics and provided them as a service in [Aalto Interface Metrics](https://github.com/aalto-ui/aim).

Before starting my M.Sc., I completed two B.Sc. degrees in Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering from [Isfahan University of Technology] (https://iut.ac.ir/en), where I was a research assistant for Dr. [Iman Izadi](https://izadi.iut.ac.ir/) and Dr. [Mohammad Hossein Manshaei] (http://www.manshaei.org/).
