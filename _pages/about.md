Hi there! Iâ€™m Amir ðŸ‘‹ I'm a first year Ph.D. student and Research Associate at the [Center for Information and Language Processing (CIS)](https://www.cis.lmu.de/) of the [University of Munich (LMU Munich)](https://www.lmu.de/de/index.html). I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Hinrich SchÃ¼tze](https://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/schuetze/).

Before starting my Ph.D., I completed my M.Sc. degree in Computer Engineering at [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.sharif.edu/), 2022. I got two B.Sc. degrees in Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering from [Isfahan University of Technology](http://english.iut.ac.ir/), 2020.

As a researcher, I am focusing my research on NLProc. Check out our new work [Hengam](https://aclanthology.org/2022.aacl-main.74/) on temporal tagging. I am also an open-source contributor to [AIM]([AIM](https://github.com/aalto-ui/aim), a service for evaluating GUIs.
