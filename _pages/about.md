Hi there! I am a Research Associate and a Ph.D. student at the [Center for Information and Language Processing (CIS)](https://www.cis.lmu.de/) of the [University of Munich (LMU Munich)](https://www.lmu.de/de/index.html). I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Henrich Schutze](https://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/schuetze/).

Before starting my Ph.D., I completed my M.Sc. degree in Computer Engineering at Sharif University of Technology. I got two B.Sc. degrees in Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering from Isfahan University of Technology.
