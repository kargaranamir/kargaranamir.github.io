I'm a <b>Computer Science Ph.D. student</b> at [<b>Munich University</b>](https://cis.lmu.de), advised by Prof. [<b>Hinrich Sch√ºtze</b>](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qIL9dWUAAAAJ). I'm also affiliated as a junior member with the [<b>Munich Center for Machine Learning</b>](https://mcml.ai). 

My current research focuses on <b>Multilingual NLP</b>, specifically on scaling NLP technologies to include more languages:

- [<b>GlotLID</b>](https://github.com/cisnlp/GlotLID): Language identification for more than 2000 languages.
- [<b>GlotWeb</b>](https://huggingface.co/spaces/cis-lmu/GlotWeb): Web-indexing service for very low-resource languages.

Before starting my Ph.D., I completed my M.Sc. degree in Computer Engineering at [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.sharif.edu/) in 2022. I earned two B.Sc. degrees in Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering from [Isfahan University of Technology](http://english.iut.ac.ir/) in 2020. Additionally, I was a research intern with the [User Interfaces group at Aalto University](http://userinterfaces.aalto.fi/) during the summers of 2021 and 2022. I contributed to the development of the [Aalto Interface Metrics (AIM)](https://github.com/aalto-ui/aim) project, a service and codebase for computational GUI evaluation.
